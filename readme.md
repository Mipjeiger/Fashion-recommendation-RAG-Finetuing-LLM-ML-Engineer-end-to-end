## 🎯 Goals Project:

- RAG LLM Finetuning fashion recommendation for giving insights business to user
- Deep learning models usin Pytorch & Tensorflow to solve business problem
- Data engineer for ingesting data in airflow, SQL, hadoop spark

## 📰 Information: The data is suitable for computer vision and deep learning tasks such as image classification, transfer learning, and fashion recommendation systems. Images were collected from an Indian e-commerce platform and cleaned by removing duplicates, corrupted files, and low-quality samples.
